# Voice AI Assistant Demo (LangGraph)

This is a demo project that showcases a modular voice assistant built using LangGraph and LangChain. The assistant handles basic user intents such as placing an order, making a reservation or logging a complaint.

## Overview

- Uses LangGraph to manage conversation flow as a state machine
- Each node represents a step in the conversation with its own prompt
- Intent-based routing (order, reservation, complaint)
- Supports multi-turn dialogue with memory of user input

## Tech Stack

- Python
- LangGraph
- LangChain (OpenAI models)
